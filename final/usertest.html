        <h2>Brenda</h2>
        <ul><li>When opening the page,  did not click on the button to start the scroll process, but then later commented that it was helpful to have.  
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Tried to hover / click / interact with the main polaroid image since other elements moved on hover (boba image and post it notes). To push it further, could have it open an overlay or change to add drawings or annotations on the image. 
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Hovering over the post it note wasn't super obvious and could make that movement more exaggerated to signal that interaction. 
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Likes the spinning of the boba (reminds her of shaking boba), the order of sections feels logical, and the color switching adds to it too. 
        </li></ul>

        <h2>Jessica</h2>
        <ul><li>Did not click scroll to start button or back to top button, but said liked the back to top button
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Also tried hovering over the polaroid image and expected an interaction there. Suggested to add a pop up with more description about the different photos like a fun fact. 
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Did not hover over the boba image but hovered over the post it note every time. Only discovered the boba image spins at the end 
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>Liked the colors for the different sections because it feels like a scrapbook. 
        </li></ul>
