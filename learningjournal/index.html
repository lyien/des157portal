            <h2>Visual Thinking Skills</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-02-09">February 9, 2023</time>
            <p>This <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">article</a> on Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills reminded me of my time in history classes in high school. I took AP World History and AP US History, and often we would practice analyzing political cartoons, photographs, and paintings with similar strategies like paying close attention to the details, placing the photo in larger historical context, and looking into the artist or maker's motivations for creating it. Throughout my time as a design student, I've noticed that visual thinking and close reading skills are key to our work as designers. When I started learning about graphic design, it was difficult for me to notice irregularities in spacing, kerning, and fonts sizes. Often my designs had small inconsistencies or minor mistakes. However, with practice, I was able to strengthen my visual thinking skills and now can be detail oriented and precise in my work. One website I found which used interactive elements is <a href="https://www.chungiyoo.com/">Chungi Yoo's portfolio.</a> As you scroll down the page, images, text, and graphics come into focus. When you hover of things, they also move in response.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-02-07">February 7, 2023</time>
            <p>The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices of Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> discusses how to correctly use a modal to enhance user
                experience. Prior to reading this article, I knew what a modal was but often referred to it as a pop-up
                instead of its official name. Although I've used modals previously in my UX/UI projects, I've never
                learned the proper guidelines and use cases officially. Generally, I try to limit the use of modals in
                my designs because they can sometimes be cumbersome and confusing as the article discusses.</p>

            <p> I found this article very helpful as it contains specifics of when to use modals (need user input or
                show additional information in context) and how to use them (location, size, including a “close”
                button). I also appreciated the discussion of including keyboard accessibility for those that use screen
                readers. Accessibility in UX design is not talked about often enough, and I will keep this in mind when
                designing modals in the future.

            <h2>Best Practices in Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-01-31">January 31, 2023</time>
            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for
                    Form Design</a> written by Salim Ansari discusses how to design forms which are efficient and easy
                to use. He discusses strategies to reduce the cognitive load of filling out forms which can often be
                cumbersome and confusing.</p>

            <p>One strategy I found particularly interesting was to position labels on the top left of the input field
                close to the top border of the field. I have encountered forms where labels are too far away from the
                field, or it is confusing to understand which field the label corresponds to. This design makes the
                label's intention clear. However, I wonder if this strategy would work for forms in languages that are
                read with different conventions than English. If a form was written in a language that read right to
                left, would the best place to put a label be on the upper right instead?</p>

            <p>An example of a website that uses well designed forms is the <a
                    href="https://www.friendlybureau.com/">Friendly Bureau</a>, which is an online art shop that uses
                Shopify to host their website. The shipping and payment forms follow several of the principles outlined
                by Ansari including sizing fields according to the character length of content, using specific labeling
                action buttons, and displaying labels when inputting information.
